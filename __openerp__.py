    "description": '''
    This module implements BOM templates, more analogous to account templates than product templates.
    
    A BOM template is created which then creates the associated BOM's. For any bom line you may specify a 
    product template with one of 2 match types One 2 One (simple case) of One Dimension to a different dimension
    where you must specify a match condition (formed as a domain expression on the dimension option object).
    
    Most of the time the simple case is fine, however when mapping different variants, it pays to use a consistent naming
    scheme.  Examples where this may be the case is say you can get a material in a certain range of colours, and paint in 
    a lot more colours so you have 2 different variant dimensions.  By giving each colour the exact same name, or code, or
    sequence number you can match differing dimensions.
    
    Alternatively where you specify a product in a bom line you can optionally specify a match expression on the
    product object which if met will add the product to the bom, otherwise it will not.  e.g say you have a variant of
    knickers, called frilly knickers, which calls for a quantity of lace then you can match that and if not the lace will
    not be added.
